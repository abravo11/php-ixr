# Introduction #
The Incutio XML-RPC library (IXR) is designed primarily for ease of use. It incorporates both client and server classes, and is designed to hide as much of the workings of XML-RPC from the user as possible. A key feature of the library is automatic type conversion from PHP types to XML-RPC types and vice versa. This should enable developers to write web services with very little knowledge of the underlying XML-RPC standard.

Don't however be fooled by it's simple surface. The library includes a wide variety of additional XML-RPC specifications and has all of the features required for serious web service implementations.

# Background / History #
The original XML-RPC library was developed back in 2002 and updated through 2003 by Incutio for a number of projects the company was working on at the time. It has become fairly dated but is still used extensively by a wide range of commercial and open-source projects.
